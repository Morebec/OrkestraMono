# Messaging
The messaging component allows handling messages in a system.
It can be used for message based communication between components of a system as well as
communicating with external systems. In a CQRS and Event Sourcing setup,
it can be used to define queries, commands and events through message buses (Command Bus, Query Bus Event Bus).
It provides contract interfaces as well as default implementations for the various concepts.

For more information please refer to the [documentation](./docs/Messaging.md).
